SET Evidence = "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease and
is a major cause of pain and disability in the older population
worldwide (Liu et al., 2015)."

path(MESH:"Osteoarthritis, Knee") pos path(MESH:Pain)

SET Evidence = "Obesity, genetic factors, and aging are some of
the most prominent risk factors (Sharma et al., 2006), and in
the younger population, previous knee injury is an important
contributor to increased prevalence of knee OA â€“ as much as half
of those sustaining a knee injury in their 20s had developed posttraumatic
knee OA in the following 12 to 14 years (Lohmander
et al., 2004, 2007; von Porat et al., 2004)."

SET Evidence = "Lately, much evidence has emerged to support a central role
for participation of local inflammatory pathways in the disease
processes (Scanzello, 2017), particularly so after knee injury
(Goldring and Otero, 2011)."

SET MeSHAnatomy = "Knee"
SET MeSHDisease = "Osteoarthritis, Knee"
path(MESH:"Knee Injuries") pos bp(GO:"inflammatory response")

SET Evidence = "As a part of the inflammatory
response after injury, oxidative stress due to formation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) is involved both in direct damage of
cartilage components and as integral factors in cell signaling
leading to cartilage degradation (Henrotin et al., 2003)."

a(MESH:"Reactive Oxygen Species") -> bp(MESH:"Oxidative Stress")
bp(MESH:"Oxidative Stress") -> path(MESH:Osteoarthritis)

SET Evidence = "In
addition to inflammation, cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) released via
hemolysis is a potent inducer of oxidative stress."

path(MESH:Hemolysis) pos p(HGNC:HBB)
p(HGNC:HBB) pos bp(MESH:"Oxidative Stress")

SET Evidence = "Spontaneous
decomposition of Hb via auto-oxidation leads to the formation
of ROS, free heme groups and free iron, which are highly reactive
and have the ability to damage lipids, proteins, and DNA (Olsson
et al., 2012)."

deg(p(HGNC:HBB)) pos complex(a(MESH:"Reactive Oxygen Species"), a(CHEBI:heme), a(CHEBI:"iron(2+)")) 

SET Evidence = "On the extracellular level, within the
circulation, haptoglobin (Hp) and hemopexin (Hpx) are two
of the most prominent scavenger proteins, with antioxidative
properties through their capacity to remove cell-free Hb (by
Hp) and heme (by Hpx)."

p(HGNC:HP) -| p(HGNC:HBB)
p(HGNC:HPX) -| a(CHEBI:heme)

SET Evidence = "A major intracellular antioxidant is
heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) which, through its heme-degrading
activity, plays a critical role in the protection of cells."

p(HGNC:HMOX1) -> deg(a(CHEBI:heme)) 

SET Evidence = "Oxidation of proteins
result in stable carbonyl groups on amino acid side chains, and
protein carbonyl content is one of the most widely used marker
of protein oxidation and a general indicator of oxidative stress
(Dalle-Donne et al., 2003)."

bp(GO:"protein oxidation") pos bp(MESH:"Oxidative Stress")

SET Evidence = "Another protein that in the last decade has been shown to
play a central role as a protective protein against oxidative stress
is a1-microglobulin (A1M) (Ã…kerstrÃ¶m and Gram, 2014)."

p(HGNC:AMBP) -| bp(MESH:"Oxidative Stress")

SET Evidence = "Of particular interest for this
investigation is that the expression of A1M has been shown to be
up-regulated in several cells and tissues during oxidative stress
conditions in response to elevated levels of ROS, Hb, and free
heme (Olsson et al., 2007, 2011)."

SET Evidence = "In serum, the A1M concentration in
the AIA group was between 1.3- and 1.4-fold higher compared
to the injury and osteoarthritis groups (p = 0.035 and 0.030,
respectively), whereas the 1.2-fold higher mean concentration
compared to the reference group was not statistically significan
(p = 0.15; Figure 1A)."

SET TextLocation = "Discussion"

SET Evidence = "When adjusted for their respective
absolute concentrations, the higher the proportion sf-A1M to
sf-heme or sf-Hb, the less oxidative damage measured as protein
carbonyl groups in synovial fluid."

SET MeSHAnatomy = "Synovial Fluid"
p(HGNC:AMBP) -| path(HM:"Oxidative damage")

SET Evidence = "These novel data support
a role for A1M in the protection against oxidative damage
due to extracellular Hb and heme in the joint in various knee
arthropathies."

p(HGNC:AMBP) -| path(HM:"Oxidative damage")

SET Evidence = "Altogether, our best interpretation of these data is that increased
levels of cell-free Hb and heme in synovial fluid early after injury
triggered an increase in the synovial fluid A1M concentration that
appeared to be protective of oxidative damage."

SET Evidence = "There are many examples of studies that have shown increased
A1M in serum or urine to be a biomarker of diseases such
as preeclampsia (Anderson et al., 2011, 2016; Gram et al.,
2015), and kidney failure (Terzi et al., 2014; Kang et al., 2015)."

SET MeSHAnatomy = "Serum"|"Urine"

in both serum and synovial fluid as a biomarker of AIA,
as suggested by the ROC-curves with AUCs close to 0.8."

SET MeSHAnatomy = "Synovial Fluid"|"Serum"

both studies, we found detectable concentrations of A1M in
synovial fluid in subjects with knee OA."

SET MeSHAnatomy = "Synovial Fluid"
p(HGNC:AMBP) pos path(MESH:"Osteoarthritis, Knee")

SET Evidence = "Expression and synthesis of A1M has been shown to be
upregulated in cells after exposure to heme and ROS (Olsson
et al., 2007, 2011)."

p(HGNC:AMBP) pos a(CHEBI:heme)
p(HGNC:AMBP) pos a(MESH:"Reactive Oxygen Species")

SET Evidence = "This is consistent with our findings here
that both heme and Hb were associated with increased levels of
synovial fluid A1M."

SET MeSHAnatomy = "Synovial Fluid"
p(HGNC:AMBP) pos a(CHEBI:heme)
p(HGNC:AMBP) pos p(HGNC:HBB)

SET Evidence = "However, with A1M increased in both synovial fluid and
serum in AIA, the present study further suggests that, in addition
to heme and ROS, A1M may be regulated by inflammatory
cytokines."

SET MeSHAnatomy = "Synovial Fluid"|"Serum"
p(HGNC:AMBP) pos a(MESH:Cytokines)

SET Evidence = "In addition to
the obvious protective benefit of exogenous A1M binding and
neutralizing cell-free Hb and heme, it may also be beneficial as
a repair mechanism in already damaged cartilage, since in vitro
studies showed that collagen fibrils were restored to normal
by addition of recombinant A1M after destruction already had
begun (Olsson et al., 2011)."

SET MeSHAnatomy = "Knee"
p(HGNC:AMBP) pos bp(MESH:"Wound Healing")

SET Evidence = "Finally, we note that in AIA A1M is
increased both locally in the joint fluid and systemically in serum,
whereas in knee injury A1M is increased only in the joint fluid."
