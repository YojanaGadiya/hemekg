and subsequent superoxide dismutation) and exogenously

concentrations (11, 32, 38, 40, 43, 45) and, therefore, may
limit oxidative injury to other cells/tissues in the vasculature

35 relative to day 14 and 28 ( p < 0.05 by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post hoc test); (ii) H2O2
significantly increased Prx-2 oxidation, which was maximal
at the first time point (5 min) measured; (iii) the magnitude of
the maximal level of Prx-2 oxidation increased with RBC
storage age ( p < 0.05 by one-way ANOVA with Tukey post
hoc test for day 7 vs. 35 for 5 min data); and (iv) dimeric Prx-2
was slowly reduced back to the monomer over 60 min;
however, this was not observed with day 35 RBC, where Prx-
2 remained > 75% oxidized."
