SET TextLocation = "Introduction"

SET Evidence = "While it is clear that PRDX2 plays an important 
role in protecting RBCs from oxidative stress, the relative 
importance of PRDX2 in scavenging H2O2 in RBC has not been 
fully elucidated."

SET Species = "Mus musculus"

degradation increases in RBCs of PRDX2 knockout 
mice in spite of the presence of catalase and GPx."

SET Cell = "erythrocyte"

SET Evidence = "These results are consistent with 
our earlier observations that the presence of SOD1 
does not significantly inhibit or accelerate the 
formation of heme degradation products during in 
vitro autoxidation of oxyHb [18].."

p(MGI:Sod1) causesNoChange deg(a(CHEBI:heme))

SET Evidence = "The small increase in heme degradation 
in the absence of SOD1 may, however, be attributed to 
low levels of heme degradation products produced either 
by the increased levels of superoxide [17] or perhaps 
the peroxynitrite that forms due to the rapid reaction 
of superoxide with any NO present."

a(CHEBI:peroxynitrite) pos deg(a(CHEBI:heme))

SET Evidence = "However, metHb levels may increase when 
there is an increase in Hb autoxidation and the 
concomitant generation of H2O2 that is not 
scavenged by antioxidant defense enzymes making 
it more difficult for metHb-reductase to keep 
up with the metHb produced."

a(CHEBI:methemoglobin) pos a(CHEBI:"hydrogen peroxide")

SET Evidence = "As shown in Figure 2, the mean metHb levels 
were also significantly increased in PRDX2 knockout mice, 
but not in SOD1 knockout mice compared with control mice."

p(MGI:Prdx2) neg a(CHEBI:methemoglobin)

SET Evidence = "As shown in Figure 3, the level of 
heme degradation is highly correlated with the level 
of metHb in RBCs (R = 0.6233, p < 0.0177) supporting 
the hypothesis that the heme degradation product 
formed in PRDX2 knockout mice is associated with 
the un-scavenged H2O2 generated during Hb 
autoxidation."

SET Cell = "erythrocyte"

SET Evidence = "It has been shown that RBC oxidative 
stress that damages the membrane reduces the 
deformability and flexibility of cells."

SET Evidence = "Figure 4 shows a significant decrease in the 
elongation index, which is a measure of deformability, 
for the PRDX2 knockout mice."

SET Evidence = "No significant change in the elongation 
index was found for the SOD1 knockout mice."

SET Evidence = "PRDX2 deficiency, thus, causes cells to undergo 
more oxidative stress during in vitro aging,
even in the presence of catalase."

p(MGI:Prdx2) neg bp(MESH:"Oxidative Stress")

SET Evidence = "The
appreciable increase in heme degradation for RBCs from PRDX2 knockout mice in the
presence of azide indicates that PRDX2 plays a major role in scavenging H2O2 in the
absence of catalase, even with GPx present."

p(MGI:Prdx2) neg a(CHEBI:"hydrogen peroxide")

SET TextLocation = "Discussion"

SET Evidence = "GPx
removes both H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides [8,31] whereas PRDX2 removes H2O2 [2],

hydroperoxides [35]."

p(MGI:Prdx2) neg a(CHEBI:peroxynitrite)

SET Evidence = "The finding that GPx has a greater role in the inhibition of heme degradation products than
catalase [3] is consistent with the primary role of catalase to react with the high
concentrations of H2O2 coming from exogenous sources and for GPx to react with the low
levels of H2O2 coming from the endogenous autoxidation of Hb [39]."

p(PFAM:GSHPx) neg a(CHEBI:"hydrogen peroxide")

SET Evidence = "The in vivo effects that we have observed for PRDX2 knockout mice (Figures 1–4) imply
that PRDX2 plays an important role in neutralizing the H2O2 generated in vivo (Figure 6)."

p(MGI:Prdx2) neg a(CHEBI:"hydrogen peroxide")

SET Evidence = "PRDX2, which is able to react with low levels of H2O2 even at reduced
glutathione levels, may therefore play a role in limiting the increased formation of heme
degradation products in older cells."

p(MGI:Prdx2) neg bp(MESH:"Oxidative Stress")

SET Evidence = "The role of PRDX2 in inhibiting impaired deformability can be attributed to both a reduction
in ROS as well as a direct reaction of PRDX2 with protein hydroperoxides [52], which will
inhibit the damage to cytoskeletal proteins required for impaired deformability."
