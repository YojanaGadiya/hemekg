SET Evidence = "Exposure of washed human peripheral blood leukocytes to protein free
crystalline heme that has been dissolved in NaOH (100 mmolL1)
with subsequent adjustment to pH 7.8 resulted in a drastic reduction
in cell surface CD62L expression on CD14 low CD15 high neutrophil
granulocytes after 30 minutes of exposure (Figure 1A)."

SET Evidence = "By modeling the
equilibrium concentration in the experiments performed with
heme-albumin we could show that the free heme is the active
neutrophil-stimulating component, which is inactivated by protein
association (Figure S2)."

a(CHEBI:heme) pos bp(GO:"neutrophil activation")

SET Evidence = "These observations
suggest that in any physiological scenario in which heme might
be present in extracellular spaces as a component of a natural
hemoprotein, the concentration of free or quasi-free heme can be
expected to be very low, possibly below the minimum range
required to trigger granulocyte activation and other innate immunity
responses."

(Figure 2A)"

SET Evidence = "In contrast, less ATP depletion was observed during exposure
to heme-albumin, and no effect could be detected when either cell
type was exposed to metHb or oxyHb at concentrations of up to
500 lmolL1, even in the absence of serum."

conditions, 4 hours of exposure to NaOH-dissolved heme induced complete
deterioration of mitochondrial respiration at concentrations as low

of 2% FCS stimulated respiratory capacity to levels above baseline."

second biochemical process relates to the ability of Hb to facilitate

mechanism behind the coexistence of inflammation and hemolysis."
