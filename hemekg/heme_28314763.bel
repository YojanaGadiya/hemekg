SET TextLocation = "Introduction"

SET Evidence = "Some of the adverse effects
caused by cell-free hemoglobin are a result of depletion of nitric oxide (NO), which
may lead to vasoconstriction, inflammation, and platelet activation (10, 24)."

SET Evidence = "Haptoglobin binds to
hemoglobin dimers and forms a high-molecular weight haptoglobin-hemoglobin
complex, which is cleared from the circulation after binding to the CD163 receptor on
hepatic and splenic macrophages (12)."

p(HGNC:CD163) -> deg(a(MESH:"haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex"))

SET Evidence = "By binding cell-free hemoglobin, haptoglobin
prevents glomerular filtration of cell-free hemoglobin and subsequent kidney injury (2,7)."

SET Evidence = "Schaer and colleagues
107 showed that administration of exogenous haptoglobin prevents extravasation of cell
free hemoglobin and vasoconstriction in rats (18)."

p(MGI:Hp) -| bp(GO:vasoconstriction)

SET Evidence = "The extensive crosslinkage of cell-free
hemoglobin in a high-molecular weight HBOC retains cell-free hemoglobin dimers in
the intravascular compartment, thereby preventing extravasation 112 of cell-free
hemoglobin into the muscular layer of the arteries where local NO consumption can
trigger vasoconstriction (25)."

a(CHEBI:"nitric oxide") -> bp(GO:vasoconstriction)

SET Evidence = "Mice with diabetes mellitus or hyperlipidemia have
evidence of endothelial dysfunction, which is associated with reduced nitric oxide
synthase (NOS) 3 activity (15, 16)."

SET Evidence = "SBP increased
224 on average 20±2 mmHg in mice injected with hemoglobin mixed with hemopexin and
225 therefore was similar to the increase after hemoglobin injection alone."

SET Evidence = "Mice that received cell
free hemoglobin together with haptoglobin had significantly higher plasma NO
258 consumption than mice that received cell-free hemoglobin alone at 60 minutes after
259 injection."

SET Evidence = "Taken together these results suggest that infusion of cell-free hemoglobin
264 mixed with an equal mass of haptoglobin is sufficient to bind cell-free hemoglobin
265 and prevent renal clearance of extracellular hemoglobin."

SET Evidence = "In mice fed a HFD or in
339 diabetic mice fed a normal diet, haptoglobin mixed with murine tetrameric

341 prevented hemoglobinuria but did not reduce hemoglobin-induced hypertension."

SET Evidence = "When mice
347 are infused with extracellular hemoglobin that has been extensively crosslinked and

SET Evidence = "In the
358 current study, we demonstrated that administration of human haptoglobin retained
359 cell-free hemoglobin in plasma, prevented hemoglobinuria, and reduced the

393 (HbS) gene knock-in or mouse models of β-thalassemia, repeated treatment with
394 hemopexin was shown to reduce chronically elevated blood pressure (21)."

395 infusion of haptoglobin or hemopexin in HbS mice inhibited hemoglobin-dependent
396 vaso-occlusion (3)."

p(MGI:Hp) -| path(HM:"vaso-occlusive crisis")

SET Evidence = "The mechanism postulated for the beneficial effects
398 of hemopexin in mouse models of chronic hemolysis involves inhibition of heme399

400 formation of reactive oxygen species and restored endothelial NOS-activity."

SET Evidence = "TLR4
401 activation by free heme would induce mobilization of P-selectin and von Willebrand
